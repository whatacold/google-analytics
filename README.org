A ClojureScript library for collecting events for Google Analytics.

*The best time to integrate an analytics service was before you shipped, the next best time is NOW.*

* Usage

1. Add the dependency to your project: [[https://clojars.org/org.clojars.kenhuang/google-analytics][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.kenhuang/google-analytics.svg]]
2. Based on where you are about to use it, you can =require= different namespaces.
** Using It in a Web App
Note: I haven't managed to do below JS in ClojureScript yet, so we need to include this in HTML at the moment (remember to replace the measurement id =G-YYYYYYYYYY= with yours):
#+begin_src html
<html>
  <head>
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-YYYYYYYYYY"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'G-YYYYYYYYYY');
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Then collect custom events in CLJS:
#+begin_src clojure
(ns demo
  (:require [google-analytics.web :as ga]))

(ga/collect-event "event_name" {:param1 1
                                :param2 "interesting"})
#+end_src
** Using It in a Chrome Extension
#+begin_src clojure
(ns demo
  (:require [google-analytics.browser-ext :as ga]))

;; init it with the measurement id and api secret
;; replace them with yours
(ga/init "G-YYYYYYYYYY" "***your api-secret***")
;; collect an event
(ga/collect-event "event_name" {:param1 "value1"})
#+end_src
