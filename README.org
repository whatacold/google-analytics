A ClojureScript library for collecting events for Google Analytics.

*The best time to integrate an analytics service was before you shipped, the next best time is NOW.*

* Usage

1. Add the dependency to your project: [[https://clojars.org/org.clojars.kenhuang/google-analytics][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.kenhuang/google-analytics.svg]]
2. Based on where you are about to use it, you can =require= different namespaces.
** Using It in a Web App

#+begin_src clojure
(ns demo
  (:require [google-analytics.web :as ga]))

(ga/init! "G-YYYYYYYYYY")
(ga/collect-event "event_name" {:param1 1
                                :param2 "interesting"})
#+end_src
** Using It in a Chrome Extension
#+begin_src clojure
(ns demo
  (:require [google-analytics.browser-ext :as ga]))

;; init it with the measurement id and api secret
;; replace them with yours
(ga/init! "G-YYYYYYYYYY" "***your api-secret***")
;; collect an event
(ga/collect-event "event_name" {:param1 "value1"})
#+end_src

Please note that it requires [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage][storage]] permission to store the client id and the session info.

More info on Google:
[[https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/sending-events][Send Measurement Protocol events to Google Analytics | developers.google.com]]
** Try the Demo
There is a demo project using shadow-cljs under =./demo/= directory, you can play with it after replacing the measurement ids and the api secret:
#+begin_src shell
# install shadow-cljs
npm install --save-dev shadow-cljs

# install react for the web app
npm install "react@17.0.2" "react-dom@17.0.2"

# watch both builds for dev
npx shadow-cljs watch :webapp :chrome-ext
#+end_src
